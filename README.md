# About Me
Hello! I'm a computer science graduate from UCL, where three years of immersive learning and hands-on problem-solving ignited my passion for technology. I then spent a year at Imperial studying Business Analytics, which sharpened my analytical skills and showed me how data can drive smart business decisions.

My journey in data analytics—whether I’m crafting visual data narratives or building multifaceted machine learning models—has taken me through four diverse industries, each offering unique insights into how technology can enhance everyday lives. I thrive on creating systems that are not only innovative but also accessible to many, and I bring clear communication, creative problem-solving, and a commitment to continuous learning to every project.

Outside of work and academics, I stay active with bouldering, basketball, athletics, and culinary adventures in the kitchen.
